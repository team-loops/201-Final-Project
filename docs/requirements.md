# HELP ME FIND WHAT TO WATCH

## Software Requirements

### Vision

There are seemingly millions of movies and shows out there these days. It can be easy to find yourself looking for something to watch on TV rather than actually relaxing to enjoy a movie or show. We are looking to change that by providing users with an app that will present movies and TVs that we know they'll love. No more searching because we make the hard work easy.

### Scope

- What our product will do?
  - Present users with questions about their favorite movies/genres.
  - Present movies based on the streaming services they choose.
  - Present a curated list of movies that the user will like based on their inputs.
  - Save the movies that the user decides that they want to watch later.

- What our product WILL NOT do?
  - Continue to learn your preferences over time.

### MVP

- We want to present users with choices from at least two different streaming services.
- We want to present users with at least 20 different results between all streaming services.
- We want want to present the user with at least 4 different unique form inputs that will help determine their next favorite show/movie.
- Add the movies you like to your personal "watch later" list that can be viewed after the options are presented.

### Stretch Goals

- Add over 100 movies to the database.
